# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
Although Dana's webpage is up and running, more in-depth analysis can be provided to enhance user experience. In this project we will provide the ability to filter for city, state, country, and shape in addition to being able to filter the table by date. This will allow the users visiting Dana's website to be able to filter for multiple criteria at the same time and help them navigate data about UFO sightings!


## Results:
The results of having five different filters allows user to filter large datasets and to be presented the data that they are interesting in seeing. Going to Dana's website the user sees this image:
