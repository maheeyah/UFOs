# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
Although Dana's webpage is up and running, more in-depth analysis can be provided to enhance user experience. In this project we will provide the ability to filter for city, state, country, and shape in addition to being able to filter the table by date. This will allow the users visiting Dana's website to be able to filter for multiple criteria at the same time and help them navigate data about UFO sightings!


## Results:
The results of having five different filters allows user to filter large datasets and to be presented the data that they are interesting in seeing. Going to Dana's website the user sees this image:

Users can see that there are five different input boxes they can fill out to filter out the dataset. Users can either filter using one criteria, such as a specific date, in this example "1/2/2010":

The data is filtered to only show the UFO sightings for the 1/2/2010.
Users can filter further by including a state along with a date, "ca" and "1/2/2010".

Users have the ability to filter by one or all criteria, the more filters the more specific or even no data is shown. 

## Summary:
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of this new design is that user has to be extremely accurate in what they are entering into the filter search, (eg the filter only understands "ca" and not "CA").
Users are able to filter five out of seven columns of data. Two recommedations for further developemnt would be including a way to filter the comments column by searching for different words that appear in the comment data (eg the color/speed of the UFO is often described in the comment section) and to be able to filter the duration of time.
